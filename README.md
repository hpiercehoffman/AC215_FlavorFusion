## Milestone 4 Deliverables ##

This milestone deals with model optimization and deployment.
- For information on data preprocessing, see our [Milestone 2 report](https://github.com/hpiercehoffman/AC215_FlavorFusion/blob/milestone3/reports/milestone2.md). Data preprocessing takes place in the **preprocess_google** and **preprocess_lsars** Docker containers.
- For information on model training, see our [Milestone 3 report](https://github.com/hpiercehoffman/AC215_FlavorFusion/blob/milestone3/reports/milestone3.md). Model training takes place in the **train** Docker container.

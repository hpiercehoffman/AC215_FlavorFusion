# Milestone 4 Overview

**Team Members**   
Varun Ullanat, Hannah Pierce-Hoffman

**Group Name**   
FlavorFusion

**Project**   
In this project, we aim to build an app that captures cultural differences in Google resturaunt reviews using abstractive summaries generated by a large language model.

## Milestone 4 Deliverables ##

This milestone deals with model optimization and deployment.
- For information on data preprocessing, see our [Milestone 2 report](https://github.com/hpiercehoffman/AC215_FlavorFusion/blob/milestone3/reports/milestone2.md). Data preprocessing takes place in the **preprocess_google** and **preprocess_lsars** Docker containers.
- For information on model training, see our [Milestone 3 report](https://github.com/hpiercehoffman/AC215_FlavorFusion/blob/milestone3/reports/milestone3.md). Model training takes place in the **train** Docker container.

### Model Optimization ###

We implemented two model optimizations: **quantization** and **pruning**. 
- Quantization optimizes a trained model by storing model weights at a lower precision. We wanted to use quantization to try to reduce the model size and speed up model inference.
- Pruning optimizes a trained model by removing weights which are close to zero. Similar to quantization, we wanted to use pruning to reduce the model size and speed up model inference. Pruning can also reduce overfitting in some cases, which would help our model generalize to new inputs during inference.



### Model Deployment: Cloud Functions ###




### notebooks ###    
This directory is currently empty, but will be used to store code which doesn't belong to a specific container, such as reports, insights, or visualizations. 

### reports ###
This directory contains our reports from past milestones:
- [Milestone 2](https://github.com/hpiercehoffman/AC215_FlavorFusion/blob/milestone3/reports/milestone2.md): Data preprocessing, Label Studio, and DVC.
- [Milestone 3](https://github.com/hpiercehoffman/AC215_FlavorFusion/blob/milestone3/reports/milestone3.md): Model training, VM setup, and experiment tracking.

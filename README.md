# Milestone 5 Overview

**Team Members**   
Varun Ullanat, Hannah Pierce-Hoffman

**Group Name**   
FlavorFusion

**Project**   
In this project, we aim to build an app that captures cultural differences in Google resturaunt reviews using abstractive summaries generated by a large language model.

## Milestone 5 Deliverables ##

This milestone deals with front-end architecture and API development.
- For information on data preprocessing, see our [Milestone 2 report](https://github.com/hpiercehoffman/AC215_FlavorFusion/blob/milestone5/reports/milestone2.md). Data preprocessing takes place in the **preprocess_google** and **preprocess_lsars** Docker containers.
- For information on model training, see our [Milestone 3 report](https://github.com/hpiercehoffman/AC215_FlavorFusion/blob/milestone5/reports/milestone3.md). Model training takes place in the **train** Docker container.
- For information on model optimization and deployment, see our [Milestone 4 report](https://github.com/hpiercehoffman/AC215_FlavorFusion/blob/milestone5/reports/milestone4.md). The scripts in the **inference_cloud_functions** directory are used for model deployment.

### Application Design ###

At this point in our development process, we created **design documents** showing the high-level architecture of our app. We created a **solution architecture** which shows the high-level strategy of our entire project, as well as a **technical architecture** which provides implementation details about how the different components of the project work together. We will discuss both design documents below. 

Note that these design documents represent a *final* implementation, meaning that some of the work is not yet completed in this milestone. We note the pending work below each image.

**Solution Architecture**

Our solution architecture shows the flow of **processes** (tasks performed by developers and users), **execution** (code running in different parts of the project pipeline), and **state** (stored objects and artifacts). In this view of the project, we abstract away technical details.

*Pending work:* Currently, we have not yet implemented HTTPS communication between the API service and the deployment stage of the ML pipeline. Instead, the API service downloads a trained model from Weights & Biases (W&B). In our final implementation, the API service will communicate with a deployed model (e.g. a cloud function).

### Frontend App ###


### Backend API ###


### notebooks ###    
This directory contains code which doesn't belong to a specific container:
- `pruning_evaluation.ipynb`: Code to evaluate and compute benchmark statistics for a base versus pruned model. 

### reports ###
This directory contains our reports from past milestones:
- [Milestone 2](https://github.com/hpiercehoffman/AC215_FlavorFusion/blob/milestone3/reports/milestone2.md): Data preprocessing, Label Studio, and DVC.
- [Milestone 3](https://github.com/hpiercehoffman/AC215_FlavorFusion/blob/milestone3/reports/milestone3.md): Model training, VM setup, and experiment tracking.
